            <h2>What is a wildfire?</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            A <b><u>wildfire</u></b> is an uncontrolled burn of vegetation, which includes the burning of <b><i>forests</b></i>, shrublands, grasslands, savannas, and croplands.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Wildfires can be caused by <b><u>human activity</u></b> — such as arson, unattended fires, or the loss of control of planned burns — and <b><i>natural causes</b></i>, such as lightning.
        </p>

        <h2>How do wildfires spread?</h2>
        <p>
            The spread of <b><u>wildfires</u></b>, once ignited, is determined by a range of factors, such as the amount and types of <b><i>dry vegetation</b></i> in the surrounding area, wind direction and speed, moisture levels, and heat. The amount of area burned by wildfires — and the impacts on ecosystems — is driven by a combination of weather patterns, human activity, the management of vegetation and landscapes, and responses to suppress their spread.

    <div class="fr4">
        <h2>How do wildfires affect humans?</h2>
        <p>
            Humans are affected by wildfires both directly and indirectly. In most years, several hundred people die directly from the <b><u>fire</u></b>. Far more — typically tens or hundreds of thousands — are evacuated, or in some cases, permanently displaced from their homes. <b><u>Wildfires</u></b> also emit particulates and local air pollutants that are damaging to human health. These fires also emit carbon dioxide — a driver of climate change — and can disrupt or damage ecosystems.
